## Research

### Research Interests
I am interested to using statistics to understand the genetic and genomic mechanisms of diseases. My methodological research has focused on:  
- Statistical Genetics and Genomics  
- High Dimensional Data  
- Statistical Computing  
- Mediation Analysis and Causal Inference  
- Bayesian Hierarchical Models  

Through the COPDGene study, my applied work has focused on the genetic epidemiology of the following phenotypes:  
- COPD  
- Spirometry  
- Nicotine dependence  
- Smoking burden  
- Coronary artery calcium  
- Thoracic aortic calcium  
- Emphysema distribution  
- Subtypes of COPD

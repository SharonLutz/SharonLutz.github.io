### pleiotropy 
An R package that tests for common and rare variant associations with multiple phenotypes using the Hausdorff metric in a permutation based framework. On [GitHub](https://github.com/SharonLutz/software/tree/master/pleiotropy) 
and implements the method from the following paper:<br>
- **Lutz SM**, Fingerlin T, Hokanson JE, Lange C. (2016) A General Approach to Testing for Pleiotropy with Rare and Common Variants. *Genetic Epidemiology*. 41(2):163-170.

### Umediation
An R package that examines the role of unmeasured confounding of the exposure-mediator-outcome relationship in mediation analysis. On [GitHub](https://github.com/SharonLutz/software/tree/master/Umediation)
 and implements the method from the following paper: <br>
- **Lutz SM**, Thwing A, Schmiege S, Kroehl M, Baker C, Starling A, Hokanon JE, Ghosh D. (2017) Examining the Role of Unmeasured Confounding in Mediation Analysis with Genetic and Genomic Applications. (Submitted)

### NPBAT
An interactive software package for the analysis of population based genetic association studies. On [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/genenpbat/home/npbat) and implements the method from the following paper: <br>

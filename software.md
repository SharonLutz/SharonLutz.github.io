## Software
My GitHub repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/SharonLutz/software)

**pleiotropy** is an R package that tests for pleiotropic relationships of genetic regions with multiple phenotypes, which is available on my github software repository.

**Umediation** is an R package that examines the role of unmeasured confounding in mediation analysis, which is available on my github software repository. 

**SecondaryPhenotype** is an R package that adjusts for ascertainment bias when testing for genetic associations of secondary phenotypes, which is available on my github software repository.

**eQTLpowerRNAseq** is an R package that runs power calculations for eQTL analysis with no replicates per subject for RNA-seq data, which is available on my github software repository.

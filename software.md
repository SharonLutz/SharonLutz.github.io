### Software Development
**NPBAT** is an interactive software package for the analysis of population based genetic association studies. On [google sites](https://sites.google.com/site/genenpbat/home/npbat) and implements the method from the following:
-Lutz SM, Yip WK, Hokanson JE, Laird N, Lange C. (2013) A General Semi-Parametric Approach to the Analysis of Genetic Association Studies in Population-Based Designs. {\it BMC Genetics}. 14(13). 

**pleiotropy** is an R package that tests for pleiotropic relationships of genetic regions with multiple phenotypes, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/SharonLutz/software/tree/master/pleiotropy)

**Umediation** is an R package that examines the role of unmeasured confounding in mediation analysis, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/SharonLutz/software/tree/master/Umediation)

**SecondaryPhenotype** is an R package that adjusts for ascertainment bias when testing for genetic associations of secondary phenotypes, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/SharonLutz/software/tree/master/SecondaryPhenotype)

**eQTLpowerRNAseq** is an R package that runs power calculations for eQTL analysis for RNA-seq data, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/SharonLutz/software/tree/master/eQTLpowerRNAseq)

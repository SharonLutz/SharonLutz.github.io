### Pleiotropy

Pleiotropy is an R package that provides two approaches to formally test for pleiotropy with a single SNP (pleiotropySNP) or a region (pleiotropyGENE). These approaches depend on permuting the phenotypes of interest and comparing the set of observed p-values to the set of permuted p-values in relation to the origin either using the Hausdorff metric or a cut-off based approach.
